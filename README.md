Project leveraging various technologies and methodologies to ensure a robust and maintainable architecture.


- Focuses on building a foundation rooted in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture principles, and SOLID principles. It emphasizes the implementation of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for better separation of concerns and cleaner code. The project utilizes advanced synchronous and asynchronous repository patterns, dynamic search capabilities, and Response-Request pattern-driven mapping using tools like AutoMapper. The Entity Framework is employed with best practices to ensure efficient data access and management. The project also covers API implementation and techniques for writing effective extensions.

- Expands upon domain modeling, advanced mapping techniques, and migration strategies. It delves deeper into implementing business rules and adhering to clean code practices. The project integrates global error handling and pipeline techniques, including validation pipelines with Fluent Validation and transactional operations.

- Introduces caching strategies utilizing both in-memory and Redis cache implementations. It also incorporates logging pipelines with Serilog for comprehensive logging capabilities.

- Covers security implementations with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and includes mailing functionalities for communication needs.

- Emphasizes a test-driven development approach, ensuring the project's reliability and maintainability through robust testing infrastructure.

In summary, this project amalgamates various cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure application architecture. It emphasizes clean code practices, separation of concerns, and test-driven development to ensure high-quality software delivery.
